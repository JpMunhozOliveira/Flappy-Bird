# Description

This is a simple Flappy Bird game created in Unity. Flappy Bird is one of the most addictive and popular mobile games of all time üì±. Developed by Vietnamese programmer Dong Nguyen and released in 2013, the game features a small bird that players must navigate through a series of obstacles by tapping the screen to make the bird flap its wings.

The game's simple yet challenging gameplay quickly became a sensation, with millions of players worldwide competing to see who could achieve the highest score üèÜ.

## Objective

The gameplay of Flappy Bird is deceptively simple, yet incredibly challenging, requiring precise timing and reflexes to navigate the bird through the obstacles. The objective of Flappy Bird is to achieve the highest score possible by skillfully maneuvering the bird through a series of pipes without touching them, all while avoiding the ground and the top of the screen.

## Conclusion

In early 2014, the game was removed from app stores by its developer due to the game's unexpected popularity and the negative impact it was having on some players.

Despite its short-lived availability, Flappy Bird remains a cultural phenomenon and a testament to the power of simple yet addictive gameplay üåü. The game's legacy has inspired countless imitations and adaptations, and its impact on the mobile gaming industry is still felt to this day.
